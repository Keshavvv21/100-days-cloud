## üñºÔ∏è Visualizing the TCP/IP Stack

```
graph TD
    A[Application Layer] --> B[Transport Layer]
    B --> C[Internet Layer]
    C --> D[Network Access Layer]
```

- **Application Layer:** Where user apps (browsers, email clients) operate
- **Transport Layer:** Handles reliable (TCP) or fast (UDP) delivery
- **Internet Layer:** Finds the best path for your data
- **Network Access Layer:** Moves bits over cables/wireless

## üß™ Hands-On Practice

Try these commands in your terminal to deepen your understanding:

### 1. Check Your IP Address
```
ipconfig      # Windows
ifconfig      # Linux/macOS (or `ip a`)
```

### 2. Test DNS Resolution
```
nslookup example.com
dig example.com
```

### 3. See Open Ports
```
netstat -an
```

### 4. Test Connectivity to a Port
```
telnet google.com 80
```

## ü©∫ Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Problem                        | Possible Cause             | Solution                         |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Can't reach a website           | DNS or network issue       | Try `ping`, check DNS settings    |
| Slow website loading            | Network congestion         | Test with `traceroute`            |
| Service not responding on port  | Firewall or service down   | Check with `netstat`, firewall    |
| Wrong website shown             | DNS cache issue            | Flush DNS cache (`ipconfig /flushdns`) |

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: What‚Äôs the difference between TCP and UDP?**  
A: TCP is reliable and ordered (good for web, email). UDP is faster but not guaranteed (good for games, streaming).

**Q: Why do we need ports?**  
A: Ports let one device run many networked programs at once (web, email, SSH, etc.).

**Q: What is a DNS resolver?**  
A: It‚Äôs a server that finds the IP address for a domain name.

**Q: How do I secure my ports?**  
A: Use a firewall to block unused ports and always use secure protocols (like HTTPS).
