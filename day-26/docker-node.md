# Docker Networking Modes

Docker containers can connect to networks in different ways depending on the networking mode used. The three common Docker networking modes are **bridge**, **host**, and **none**. Each mode controls how containers communicate with each other, the host system, and the outside world.

## 1. Bridge Mode (Default)

- This is Docker's default networking mode.
- Containers on the bridge network can communicate with each other through a virtual bridge.
- Containers are isolated from the host’s network but can access external networks through the host.
- Useful when you want container-to-container communication within the same host without exposing container ports directly to the host.

Example command to create a user-defined bridge network:
```
docker network create my-bridge-network
```

For more details, see the official Docker docs on the [Bridge network driver](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/drivers/bridge/) and a detailed lab explanation [Exploring Docker Network Modes](https://labex.io/tutorials/docker-docker-local-network-16256).

## 2. Host Mode

- The container shares the host’s network stack.
- The container’s network interfaces are not isolated from the host.
- This mode allows the container to have direct access to the host’s network interfaces, which can improve network performance but reduces isolation.
- Typically used for applications that require low network latency.

More information is available on Stack Overflow in the discussion of [Docker 'host' and 'none' networks](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41083328/what-is-the-use-of-docker-host-and-none-networks).

## 3. None Mode

- Disables all networking for the container.
- The container has no network interfaces (except for a loopback interface).
- Useful for containers that do not require network access.

## Summary Table

| Mode   | Description                                 | Use Case                             |
|--------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Bridge | Default, isolated container network          | Container communication within host |
| Host   | Shares host network stack                     | Low latency, direct access needs    |
| None   | No network access                             | Containers without network needs    |
