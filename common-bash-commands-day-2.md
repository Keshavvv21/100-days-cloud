## Practical Example

Try this sequence to create a directory, add a file, and verify its contents:

mkdir practice_dir
cd practice_dir
touch example.txt
echo "Hello World" > example.txt
cat example.txt
ls -l
```

## Practice Exercises

- **Navigation Challenge**
  - Use `cd` and `ls` to locate a hidden file named `.solution` in a directory tree.
  - Reveal it with `ls -a`.

- **Script Execution**
  - Create a script (`touch hello.sh`) with:
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "Practice makes perfect!"
    ```
  - Run it with `source hello.sh`.

- **File Operations**
  - Copy a file to a new directory with `cp`.
  - Rename it using `mv`.
  - Delete a backup with `rm`.

- **Variable Practice**
  - Assign text to a variable: `msg="Bash Mastery"`
  - Print it with `echo $msg`
  - Concatenate strings: `echo "${msg} achieved!"`
