# Docker Networking Modes: README.md with Links

Start your Docker journey with a clear understanding of the main networking modes. Here is a concise guide with official links for each:

***

## Bridge Network
- **Default for most containers.**
- Creates a private internal network on the host where containers get an IP on the subnet and can communicate with each other.
- Suitable for container-to-container communication and port mapping to the host.
- **Docs:** [Bridge network driver](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/drivers/bridge/)[1]

***

## Host Network
- **No network isolation between container and host.**
- Container uses the host’s network stack directly—no port mapping needed, but may cause port conflicts and impacts isolation/security.
- Useful for high-performance applications needing direct host network access (like monitoring agents).
- **Docs:** See "host" in [Docker Networking Basics, Network Types & Examples](https://dev.to/tusharops_29/docker-networking-basics-network-types-examples-5ed7)[2]

***

## None Network
- **Complete network isolation.**
- Only loopback (`lo`) interface is present. No networking -- container can't communicate externally or with other containers.
- Best for very secure batch jobs or testing where no external access is needed.
- **Docs:** [None network driver](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/drivers/none/)[3]

# Docker Networking Modes

This project explains the three main Docker networking modes—bridge, host, and none:

## Bridge Network
The default mode for most containers, bridge networking isolates containers but allows communication on a private subnet. See: [Bridge network driver](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/drivers/bridge/)

## Host Network
Host networking disables isolation, allowing containers to use the host’s network stack directly. Details: [Docker Networking Basics, Network Types & Examples](https://dev.to/tusharops_29/docker-networking-basics-network-types-examples-5ed7)

## None Network
None mode isolates the container completely; only the loopback interface is available. Learn more: [None network driver](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/drivers/none/)

> Choose the correct mode based on your security, performance, and connectivity needs!
