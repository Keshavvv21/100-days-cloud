# 🐳 Docker Volumes and Bind Mounts

This guide explains **Docker Volumes** and **Bind Mounts**, their differences, use cases, and how to persist and manage data (including configs and paths) in Dockerized environments.

---

## 📦 What Are Docker Volumes?

Docker **volumes** are a way to persist data created or used by containers. Docker manages these volumes under the hood, typically in `/var/lib/docker/volumes/`.

### ✅ Use Volumes When:
- You need data persistence across container restarts or rebuilds.
- You want Docker to manage the storage location.
- You need safe sharing of data between containers.

### 🛠️ Create and Use a Volume

```bash
# Create a named volume
docker volume create my_volume

# Use the volume in a container
docker run -d \
  --name my_container \
  -v my_volume:/app/data \
  my_image
````

## 🔗 What Are Bind Mounts?

Bind mounts let you mount **a specific path on your host** into a container. This allows live file updates and is ideal for development workflows.

### ✅ Use Bind Mounts When:

* You want to sync code between host and container in real-time.
* You're debugging or iterating in a dev environment.
* You need full control over the host path being used.

### 🛠️ Use a Bind Mount

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name dev_container \
  -v /path/on/host:/app/code \
  my_image
```

## 🆚 Volumes vs Bind Mounts

| Feature                | Docker Volumes | Bind Mounts          |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | -------------------- |
| Managed by Docker      | ✅ Yes          | ❌ No                 |
| Recommended for Prod   | ✅ Yes          | ⚠️ No (for dev only) |
| Host Location Control  | ❌ No           | ✅ Yes                |
| Use in Dev             | ⚠️ Sometimes   | ✅ Yes                |
| File Permission Issues | Rare           | More Common          |
| Easy Backup/Restore    | ✅ Yes          | ❌ Manual             |

## 📂 Storing Configs or Paths in Docker Volumes

Docker volumes are excellent for storing **configuration files**, app **settings**, and environment-specific data **outside the image** — this makes containers reusable across environments.

---

### 🧪 Example: Mounting a Volume for Config Files

#### 1. Prepare a config file on the host

```bash
mkdir my-config
echo '{ "env": "production", "logLevel": "info" }' > my-config/config.json
```

#### 2. Run a container with the config mounted as a bind mount

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name app_with_config \
  -v $(pwd)/my-config:/app/config \
  my_app_image
```

> This mounts the host directory `my-config` into `/app/config` in the container.

---

### 📁 Example: Copying Config to a Named Volume

Alternatively, let Docker manage the storage using a **named volume**.

#### 1. Create a volume and copy configs into it

```bash
# Create a named volume
docker volume create app_config

# Use a temporary container to copy files into the volume
docker run --rm \
  -v app_config:/config \
  -v $(pwd)/my-config:/source \
  alpine cp /source/config.json /config/config.json
```

#### 2. Run your container using the volume

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name app_with_named_config \
  -v app_config:/app/config \
  my_app_image
```

#### 🧾 Inside the App

Your app can now read the config like this:

```javascript
// Example: Node.js
const fs = require('fs');
const config = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('/app/config/config.json'));
console.log(config.env); // "production"
```

---

## 🧼 Volume Management Commands

```bash
# List volumes
docker volume ls

# Inspect a volume
docker volume inspect my_volume

# Remove a volume
docker volume rm my_volume

# Clean up all unused volumes
docker volume prune
```

---

## 🧾 Bonus: Real-World Use Case

### 🎯 Use Case: PostgreSQL with Volume for Data

```bash
docker volume create pgdata

docker run -d \
  --name postgres_db \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecret \
  -v pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  postgres
```

### 🎯 Use Case: Node.js App with Source Code (Bind Mount)

```bash
docker run -it \
  --name node_dev \
  -v $(pwd):/usr/src/app \
  -w /usr/src/app \
  node:18 \
  bash
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

* Always use **named volumes** in **production**.
* Use **bind mounts** in **development** for fast feedback.
* Don't store **sensitive secrets** in bind mounts unless managed securely.
