# 🐳 Multi-Stage Docker Builds – Example Project

This project demonstrates how to use **multi-stage builds in Docker** to create smaller, faster, and more secure Docker images.

Multi-stage builds help you:
- Separate build-time and runtime dependencies
- Reduce final image size
- Avoid leaking source code or credentials into production images

## 📦 What's Inside

This repository contains an example project (e.g., Node.js, Python, Go, etc.) along with a `Dockerfile` that uses multiple stages:

- **Stage 1**: Build the application
- **Stage 2**: Copy only necessary artifacts into a clean runtime image

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🛠 Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed and running

### 📂 Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multi-stage-docker-example.git
cd multi-stage-docker-example
````

### 🐳 Build the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t my-app:latest .
```

### ▶️ Run the Container

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 my-app:latest
```

---

## 🔍 Example Dockerfile

```Dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Runtime
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install --production
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```

Replace with your preferred language/environment (e.g., Python, Go, Rust).

Let me know if you'd like to customize it for a specific tech stack like **React**, **Flask**, or **Go** — I can adjust the example Dockerfile and README accordingly.
